 # Portfolio Optimization:
 objective : Execute strategy that takes positions on a set of assets and backtest data to maximize the Sharpe ratio
 
	*Coded strategy using Stochastic Oscillator for entry points, and support/resistance via Donchian channels for risk levels 
	*Performed hyperparameter optimization using Grid Search and found a maximum Sharpe Ratio of 1.7 on multiple assets 
 
#IPL Score Prediction:
objective :To predict the final score of the first innings of an IPL match, given detailed information about each ball 
	
*Performed EDA, merged the dataset with IPL players' stats, and performed column transformation using One-Hot Encoder 

*Trained and tested the model on various machine learning regression algorithms and compared accuracy on a barplot 
	
 *Achieved the accuracy of the model to 93% by using a random forest regressor which outperformed other algorithms
